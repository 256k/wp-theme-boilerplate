# static-site-boilerplate
This is a boilerplate project for all of my basic html css js projects built with the tools in consistently use along with bootstrap integrated into the dev environment.


dev:
===
Run `gulp` in terminal to start the gulp task and watcher. it will combine all sass (scss) files into a single style.css file and watch any file whether php, scss or js and reload the browser automatically upon changes.

build: *currently not functional*
===

Run `gulp build` and a new folder will be created called dist. all assets will be copied along with all files in the dev folder along with the combined css file. you can simply just copy this folder and upload it it as your production site.
